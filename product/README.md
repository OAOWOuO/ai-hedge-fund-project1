# DRIVER Project

This project follows the DRIVER methodology for finance/quant tool development.

## Workflow

1. `/driver:define` — Establish vision, research what exists (开题调研)
2. `/driver:represent-roadmap` — Break into 3-5 buildable sections
3. `/driver:implement-screen` — Build and run, iterate on feedback
4. `/driver:validate` — Capture evidence it works
5. `/driver:evolve` — Generate final export package
6. `/driver:reflect` — Capture lessons learned

## Philosophy

**Cognition Mate (认知伙伴):** 互帮互助，因缘合和，互相成就

- AI brings: patterns, research, heavy lifting on code
- You bring: vision, domain expertise, judgment
- Neither creates alone. Meaning emerges from interaction.

## Next Step

Run `/driver:define` to begin.
